# Flutter Chainz Demo

My first ever Flutter project. Code a demo of symbol tables using hashing with separate chaining.

The initial code quality is somewhat poor given that this is a first attempt. Any feedback related to structuring Dart or widgets is much appreciated. Please use the issue system on GitHub.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
